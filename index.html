        <h2>About "Me"</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Hrisika. I like all things art and coding. I play Minecraft sometimes, and I have an unhealthy obsession with Youtube, Photoshop and Twitch. I also know Java. Kind of. and C#. also not great. But I know the basics so.... yeah. </p>
    
        <h2> The About Paragraphs</h2>
        <p>This is generally supposed to be an about page about my and my favorite language to code in. I personally think it would be undair to say that I have any one favorite language when I still have so much to learn about cs and coding in general... it seems almost unfair for me to choose a favorite. Also, I'm incredibly indecisive anyway, so I think it's better that I don't try to choose one so that I can turn this assignment in on time. </p>
